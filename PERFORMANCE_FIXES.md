# Performance Optimizations for Sigma Chatter

This document describes the performance optimizations implemented to fix reloading and flickering issues in the Sigma Chatter application.

## Frontend Optimizations

### React Rendering Optimizations

1. **Removed React StrictMode**
   - Prevented double rendering of components in development mode

2. **Optimized Connection Status Component**
   - Created a memoized version to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Implemented lazy loading to defer loading until needed
   - Added timeouts to prevent flickering during brief disconnections

3. **State Management Optimizations**
   - Added state comparison in `useChatStore` to prevent unnecessary state updates
   - Implemented proper cleanup for socket connections and event listeners
   - Used refs to track and clear timeouts properly

### Performance Enhancements

1. **Hardware Acceleration**
   - Added CSS properties to enable GPU acceleration for animations
   - Applied hardware acceleration only to elements that need it, not globally
   - Added will-change hints for critical animated components

2. **CSS Optimizations**
   - Created enhanced animation fixes
   - Prevented Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC) with class-based controls
   - Added support for users who prefer reduced motion

3. **Network Optimizations**
   - Added preconnect and dns-prefetch for the backend API
   - Configured proper cache control headers for API responses
   - Modified static file serving to include caching headers

### Build Optimizations

1. **Vite Configuration**
   - Disabled Fast Refresh in development to prevent reload loops
   - Optimized chunk sizes for better loading performance
   - Added manual chunks for vendor code to improve caching

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Added flags to disable diagnostics and connection status in development
   - Configured throttling for high-frequency events

## Backend Optimizations

1. **API Response Headers**
   - Added proper cache control headers to prevent caching of dynamic content
   - Configured static file caching for improved performance

2. **Socket.io Configuration**
   - Configured socket to connect only when authenticated
   - Implemented proper disconnect and cleanup logic

## How to Test

1. Start the backend server on port 5001:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the frontend on port 5173:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Verify the application runs smoothly with no flickering or constant reloads

## Troubleshooting

If you still experience rendering issues:

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify all environment variables are correctly set
3. Try clearing your browser cache
4. Ensure you're using the latest code changes
